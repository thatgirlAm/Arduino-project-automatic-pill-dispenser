# Arduino-project-automatic-pill-dispenser
Here's a repo linked to a project I got to do in school : creating an automatic pill dispenser with an Arduino card. 

## What will be the main components ? 

The User Interface is an Android app created with MIT's tool for app creation.
<br>Here's the link to the website : https://appinventor.mit.edu (or you can click the image).

### Electronics...
<br>The Arduino board communicates with the tablet through a bluetooth module. 
<br>The bluetooth module has 4 pins : VCC+ (3,7 to 5V), the GRND, the TX (transmitor) and the RX (the receptor).
<br><b>Warning : The transmittor of the arduino is connected to the receptor of the module and its receptor to the transmittor of the bluetooth module.</b>
